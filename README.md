# TA-detection-backfill
This TA can be used to fill in detection gaps following a period of data collection interruption. Once data are recovered in Splunk, this application can be used to restart scheduled searches during this outage.

This application was largely inspired from the [Splunk Rerun app](https://github.com/murchisd/splunk_rerun_app) made by Donald Murchison
